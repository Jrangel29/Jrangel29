<h1 align="center">Hi Stranger, I'm João 👋</h1>
<h3 align="center">An aspiring full-stack developer from Portugal</h3>

<p align="left">I'm a developer who is passionate about turning design ideas into fully fledged, working products. Most of my experience is focused on front-end development, but I also have some experience working with backend technologies. Professionally, my main goal is to become the most complete full-stack developer I can be. 👨‍💻 <br> All of my personal coding projects are built from the ground up, from planning their features, all the way to the design and implementation via code. While working in projects that involve a team, although I'm more passionate and experienced working with frontend development, I try to be as helpful as I can, and do a little bit of everything... that doesn't involve designing the interfaces, of course. 👀 <br> Currently, I'm learning more about C# testing with specflow, and also solidifying my JavaScript knowledge. 💡</p>

   <summary><h3>👨‍💻 My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   <p>
     I started my coding journey in college. I enrolled in New Technologies of Communication, at the University of Aveiro. There, I was able to learn a lot about all the stages and facets of web development, throught a project based learning method, where I got to work with both the front-end side of development, as well as the back-end side of things. Thanks to this opportunity, I got to develop my skills as a JavaScript developer, along with multiple technologies and frameworks associated to it, such as React, Bootstrap, Node and Express. After completing my bachelors, I enrolled in a Masters in Communication Technologies, where I got to hone my skills even more, developing more projects following the same project based methodology. To finish my academic path, I got an opportunity to work in a research grant, where I developed a back-office platform to create, schedule and manage notifications for the TV ecosystem.
   Now, I'm currently working as a Site Reliability Engineer at Volkswagen Financial Services, where I get to work with, and learn more about, the lifecycle of the development and maintenance of market ready applications.
